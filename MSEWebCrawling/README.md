Get Basic Board Informations
(such as Notice Board , Free Board) 

- Notice ...  Done!
  Need attachments part. (Seems Easy) -> (Confirmed hard)
  
- All Boards ...  Done!
  Need attachments part. (Seems Easy) -> (Confirmed hard)

- Professor Contacts ... Done!
  Since the emails of professors are saved as an image file, I used OCR to get professor's emails.
  api.ocr.space -> Free , but kind of slow for now.
  (I am trying to use pytesseract which uses google's Tesseract OCR engine. But I don't know how to get it)
  
  It returns JSON file as it's result. 

- Getting Recent Posts Automatically from both boards(Notice, Normal)
  By using index, we can get the recent post ids.


TODO List
- Need to add commands. (Seems easy)

- Getting Schedules Board. (Seems kind of not that useful)



All the functions are named ~KnockKnock Since I was listening to Knock Knock by Twice when I was looking for it's Names :P
